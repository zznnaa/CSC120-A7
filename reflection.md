Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?
    House: Constructor & moveIn. I overloaded the constructor to default to assuming no dining room or elevator existed because I thought that would make it faster to create houses on the map. I overloaded moveIn to not allow students with accomodations to move into a house without an elevator because that isn't allowed at Smith in real life and you would want someone to alert you about that before moving in.

    Library: Constructor & isAvaliable. I overloaded the constructor to define what media type the library is - e.g. book, video game, DVD, etc. I also overloaded isAvaliable to print whether all books are currently avaliable / unavaliable as a quick way to view if any books are checked out.

    Cafe: Constructor & sellCoffee. I overloaded both of these to allow for variable stock and restock inputs that the user can customize.

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
    Worked: reading over all the code again so I actually knew what was going on and how everything worked
    Didn't: having to rewrite a few sections of code I didn't do propertly last time oops
    Advice: start early!
